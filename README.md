## Getting Started

Simply clone down this repository, install dependencies, and get started on your application.

The use of the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager is **strongly** recommended, as opposed to using `npm`.

\*\*I am just using npm and it seems fine

# install dependencies

npm i

```

### Development Scripts
I am developing with `npm run dev`
```
